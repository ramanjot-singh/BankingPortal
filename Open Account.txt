OnlineSBI enables you to open a new account online. 
You can apply for a new account only in branches where 
you already have accounts. You should have an INB-enabled 
account with transaction right in the branch. Funds in an 
existing account are used to open the new account. You can 
open Savings, Current, Term Deposit and Recurring Deposit 
accounts of Residents, NRO and NRE types.

Just log on to retail section of the Internet Banking site 
with your credentials and select the New Account link under 
Requests tab. You can see all types of accounts. Select the 
account and account type you wish to open and submit the same. 
Then, you need to select the branch and enter the initial amount 
to open the account. You can select any of your accounts for 
debiting the initial amount. Then, submit the transaction. 
Your new account opening request will be processed by the branch.
